This repository houses a game project I developed during a coding bootcamp journey inspired in connect 4, a classic game. Or maybe not as classic, and I'm an oldie. 

Anihow, it was a pivotal experience as it marked my first encounter with **testing** and sparked my interest in **functional programming** and clean coding principles, such as KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).

Unfortunately, I didn't manage to finish the game as such since I pursued other challenges more related to web development. 

Nevertheless, it's still here because it was so interesting to build back in the day.
